# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)  

## Overview
The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** is a hands-on learning program designed to take students and enthusiasts through the **complete digital ASIC design flow** using open-source tools. The program covers **everything from RTL design to GDSII**, giving participants practical exposure to real-world chip design workflows.  

This repository documents all tasks, scripts, and snapshots created during the program, organized **week-by-week**.  

---

## Program Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of **digital ASIC design** using RISC-V SoC as a case study.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **open-source EDA tools**, including synthesis, simulation, layout, and verification.  
- Understand the complete flow from **RTL → Netlist → Floorplanning → Placement → Routing → GDSII**.  
- Build reproducible designs and document all installation, setup, and verification steps.

## Key Features
- **Open-Source Workflow:** Fully relies on open-source tools like Yosys, Iverilog, GTKWave, Ngspice, Magic VLSI, and OpenLane.  
- **Step-by-Step Documentation:** Each week’s tasks, installation scripts, and verification snapshots are included.  
- **Educational Focus:** Emphasizes understanding over automation; includes notes, tips, and troubleshooting guidance.  
- **Ready for Tapeout:** Designs prepared can be used with SkyWater 130nm PDK for fabrication.
